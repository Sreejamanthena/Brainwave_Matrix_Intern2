🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance it before training a Random Forest classifier.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Random Forest Classifier

Joblib (for model serialization)

📂 Data Not Included
The dataset is too large to upload directly.
You can manually download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ folder:
